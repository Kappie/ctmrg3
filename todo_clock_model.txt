Central questions:
- check if I find if a different pseudocritical point if I minimize energy gap
  instead of maximize entropy? Should we scale in entropy or in some length scale?


Technical todo:
- check if increasing tolerance matters for pseudocritical point (seems to matter)

- resolve the degeneracy going on. Which chi values to take?

- for q = 6 check if symmetric boundary conditions give better results
  (since magnetization should be zero anyway)

- check how singular values should scale if we want to calculate entropy?

- check why a power law still works at the kosterlitz thouless transition
